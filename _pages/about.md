I am a Lecturer in Geospatial Data Science at the University of Glasgow, starting in August 2024. I hold a Ph.D. in Geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (from January 2021 to May 2024). Since then, my research has been exploring innovative applications and development of Geospatial Data Science and Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI).

My professional journey before academia includes significant industry experience as a Big Data Scientist, where I developed advanced geospatial routing algorithms, bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation. I earned my Master’s degree in GIS/Cartography from UW-Madison, building on dual Bachelor’s degrees in GIS & Remote Sensing from the University of Cincinnati and Sun Yat-sen University (2+2 program).

This diverse, multidisciplinary academic and professional background has shaped my research, which is primarily focused on harnessing the power of Geospatial Data Science and GeoAI to address critical challenges in human mobility, segregation, urban analytics, and environmental and climate studies. My work is essentially driven by a strong commitment to fostering social-environmental sustainability, equity, and justice through geospatial innovations. I am particularly interested in the rapid advancements in foundation models (e.g., ChatGPT) and how these models can transform geospatial applications.

My long-term research goal is to pioneer the development of GeoAI-empowered Foundation Models (GeoFM), creating a multimodal learning framework that integrates spatial knowledge from diverse geospatial data sources, such as text, images, audio, and video. This work has the potential to significantly enhance geospatial analysis and decision-making, ultimately contributing to more informed and equitable societal outcomes. 

I am always keen to explore collaborative opportunities and welcome inquiries from prospective Ph.D. students who are passionate about pushing the boundaries of Geospatial Data Science and GeoAI. Please feel free to contact me via meiliu.wu@glasgow.ac.uk for any collaboration, discussion of ideas, or Ph.D. student opportunities. I’m always happy to start a conversation over a coffee break!

My motto: "Innovating with Purpose - Pioneering Geospatial AI for a Sustainable Future."
